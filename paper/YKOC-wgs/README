# Run DeletionID on WGS data of the YKOC

# Metadata with strain information, EBI accessions, and gene name maps.
The `201213_STable1_del2srs.txt` file was pulled from Puddu et al, 2019 in the 
supplementary information section and maps the ERS accessions to which background
or which gene was knocked out in those samples. This table was downloaded on 
December 13, 2020.

The `210223_EBIaccessions_PRJEB27160.txt` file was pulled to get the run accessions
(ERRXXXXXXX) for downloading the FASTQ files for each sample. The following url was 
accessed on February 23, 2021 to download this metadata.

The `210316_sgd_names_and_aliases` file was pulled from YeastMine on March 16, 2021.

# Download & Align YKOC data
Use the EBI accessions to download the data to the `results/FASTQ` directory. The 
`job/00_download_data.pbs` PBS script uses the `wget` command but for the paper, these
files were downloaded using Globus. The FASTQ files are aligned with BWA-MEM by 
running the `job/01_align_fastq.pbs` PBS script. 

# Run YKOC through DeletionID
The BAM files are fed to DeletionID using the `job/02_indexed_runDID.pbs` PBS script.

# Compare the results to the metadata information
Evaluate the accuracy of DeletionID on real data using the `job/03_tally_results.pbs`
PBS script which calls the `script/analyze_ykoc_results.py` Python script.
