# Run EpitopeID on ENCODE data and evaluate EptiopeID's performance


# Reference files
ENCODE metadata was pulled on February 21, 2021 using the `scripts/get_metadata.py`
script that pulls all Genetic Modification accessions with category=insertion and 
purpose=tagging. These are used to pull Biosample accessions with the organism=
human constraint. The File accessions with type=FASTQ are finally pulled with the 
filter that they are associated with Libraries that come from one of these Biosample
accesions are identified and saved with all relevant metadata collected along the
way to the `210221_sample_metadata.txt` file.

Command used: python scripts/get_metadata.py > 210221_sample_metadata.txt

# Download ENCODE eGFP data and run through EpitopeID
Use the files.txt with ENCODE accessions to download the data to the data directory.
Then make sure the LAP-tag is in the hg19_EpiID and run the data through EpitopeID.

# Compare the results to the metadata information
Evaluate the accuracy of EpitopeID on real data.
