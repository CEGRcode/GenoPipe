The N-terminal cassette has a dual eukaryotic-prokaryotic promoter (PGK-gb2) driving a neomycin-kanamycin resistance gene within an artificial intron inside the tag coding sequence. The selection cassette is flanked by two loxP sites and can be permanently removed by Cre Recombinase-mediated excision. The C-terminal cassette contains the sequence encoding the tag followed by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in front of the neomycin resistance gene. In addition, a short bacterial promoter (Gb3) drives the expression of the neomycin-kanamycin resistance gene in E. coli.

The selection cassette is flanked by two loxP sites and can be permanently removed by Cre Recombinase-mediated excision. The C-terminal cassette contains the sequence encoding the tag followed by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in front of the neomycin resistance gene. In addition, a short bacterial promoter (Gb3) drives the expression of the neomycin-kanamycin resistance gene in E. coli.

The selection cassette is flanked by two loxP sites and can be permanently removed by Cre Recombinase-mediated excision. The C-terminal cassette contains the sequence encoding the tag followed by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in front of the neomycin resistance gene.

The N-terminal cassette has a dual eukaryotic-prokaryotic promoter (PGK-gb2) driving a neomycin-kanamycin resistance gene within an artificial intron inside the tag coding sequence. The selection cassette is flanked by two loxP sites and can be permanently removed by Cre Recombinase-mediated excision. The C-terminal cassette contains the sequence encoding the tag followed by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in front of the neomycin resistance gene. In addition, a short bacterial promoter (Gb3) drives the expression of the neomycin-kanamycin resistance gene in E. coli.

The N-terminal cassette has a dual eukaryotic-prokaryotic promoter (PGK-gb2) driving a neomycin-kanamycin resistance gene within an artificial intron inside the tag coding sequence. The selection cassette is flanked by two loxP sites and can be permanently removed by Cre Recombinase-mediated excision. The C-terminal cassette contains the sequence encoding the tag followed by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in front of the neomycin resistance gene. In addition, a short bacterial promoter (Gb3) drives the expression of the neomycin-kanamycin resistance gene in E. coli.
